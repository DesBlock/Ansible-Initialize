  build-essential:
    Description: |
      Informational list of build-essential packages
      If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
      package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
      for building Debian packages.
      .
      This package contains an informational list of packages which are
      considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
      depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
      build-essential packages installed.
      .
      If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
      a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
      package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
      to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
      package depends on.
      .
      This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
      build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
      This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
      most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
      the manual is correct.
  csvkit:
    Description: |

      .
      It is written in portable C, and it has minimal runtime
      dependencies.
      .
      jq can mangle the data format that you have into the
      one that you want with very little effort, and the
      program to do so is often shorter and simpler than
      you’d expect.
  jython:
    Description: |

      utility for directing compilation
      GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
      and other target files of a program from the program's source
      files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
      need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
      them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
      are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
      corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
      computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
      solver.

      As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
      mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
      determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
      it sends a sequence of ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
      quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
      running statistics about each machine.
      .
      mtr-tiny is compiled without support for X and conserves disk space.

      This package identifies and fingerprints Web Application Firewall (WAF)
      products using the following logic:
      .
        - Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a
          number of WAF solutions.
        - If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious)
          HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
        - If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously
          returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security
          solution is actively responding to the attacks.
